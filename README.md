# Discord Snipe bot 

Basic 2 commands that spits out the most recently deleted message using discord.py 2.0.0a

<h1> ðŸ¤¨ What is the purpose? </h1>

There is a popular demand for snipe bots among users and since snipebots are nearing their end in terms of
discord's new message content policy, I wanted to make this for anyone hoping to create their own snipebot for their server.

<h2> Commands </h2>

`snipe` <br>

`snipeedit`
